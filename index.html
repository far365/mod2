  <p id="p1">Chickens</p>
  <section>Another way to make tasty, tender chicken is to add it to a salt-and-sugar rub. For chicken breasts, blend 1/3 cup of course salt and 1/3 cup of brown sugar with a mixture of your favorite seasonings. A tablespoon each of ground black pepper, paprika and chili powder are good seasonings to spice up this mix.

  <p id="p2">Fish</p>
    <section>
You can remove some of the fishy flavor by soaking the fish in a mixture of baking soda and water for thirty minutes before cooking. I've been trying out a ton of different fish lately and the one that really stuck out was paiche. It really does taste like chicken.

  <p id="p3">Susi</p>
    <section>The trick is to zap it in the microwave for 30 seconds. (Just make sure you take it out of the container first, of course.) A little bit of heating will fluff up the rice and enhance those delicious flavors you love so much. A half a minute is the sweet spot for saving that store-bought sushi.
